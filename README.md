- 👋 Hi, I’m @Adrian11tm coder by day, meme connoisseur by night!
- 👀 I’m interested in tech that makes life easier (and cooler), random facts about space, and perfecting my coffee-making skills ☕️.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to make my code as funny as my jokes… and maybe a bit of AI on the side.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that need a sprinkle of creativity, a dash of humor, and some solid C/C++ Html JavaScript Python coding skills.
- 📫 How to reach me  carrier pigeons work, but email might be faster!
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him (or “Wizard of Technology” – aspiring title, career goal).
- ⚡ Fun fact: I dream of the day I’ll become the “Wizard of Technology” – until then, I’m training among bugs and lines of code!
